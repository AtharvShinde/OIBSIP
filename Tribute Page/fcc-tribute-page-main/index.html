          <h2>About</h2>
          <h3><br>&bull; Investor with a Midas touch, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, who passed away in August 2022, was often referred to as India's Warren Buffett.</h3>
          <h3><br>&bull; Son of an income tax officer, Jhunjhunwala started dabbling in stocks while still in college.</h3>
          <h3><br>&bull; He began investing with $100 in 1985 when the Bombay Stock Exchange Index was at 150; it now trades over 50,000.</h3>
          <h3><br>&bull; The most valuable listed holding in his portfolio at the time of his death was watch and jewellery maker Titan, part of the Tata conglomerate.</h3>
          <h3><br>&bull; Jhunjhunwala's early bets on Star Health and Allied Insurance and Metro Brands paid off when both companies listed in 2021.</h3>
